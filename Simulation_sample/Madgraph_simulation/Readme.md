Here are the simulations from Madgraph. All these samples are for the first radiation length approximation.

each benchmark has 50k events, except that 1GeV, 2GeV, 3GeV, 4GeV have 500k events.

m_1e_3GeV means 1e-3GeV mass

m_5e_4GeV means 5e-4GeV mass

m_2GeV means 2.0GeV mass

Kinematics.nb is the mathematica file for extracting the data.

total_number_mCP_include_formfactor.nb includes the total number of mCP and anti-mCP for production.
