Here are the simulations from Madgraph. All these samples are for the first radiation length approximation. Due to large size of sample file, the samples are moved to the below google drive.

each benchmark has 50k events, except that 1GeV, 2GeV, 3GeV, 4GeV have 500k events.

m_1e_3GeV means 1e-3GeV mass

m_5e_4GeV means 5e-4GeV mass

m_2GeV means 2.0GeV mass

Kinematics.nb is the mathematica file for extracting the data.

total_number_mCP_include_formfactor.nb includes the total number of mCP and anti-mCP for production.
