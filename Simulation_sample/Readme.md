Here are the simulated samples, including shower. (currently only including bremsstrahlung process)

bremsstrahlung process: e- N -> e- N mCP+ mCP-

bremsstrahlung process: e+ N -> e+ N mCP+ mCP- where the e+ appears during QED shower

You can also find the sample file in Google drive:

For example:

the benchmark for Mass of mCP is 0.1 GeV, please use ./m_1e_1GeV/m_1e_1GeV.csv

don't use ./m_1e_1GeV/m_1e_1GeV_10GeV.csv , ./m_1e_1GeV/m_1e_1GeV_9GeV.csv , ...

Inside the .csv sample file, each row refers to one mCP's 4-momentum and weight: {px, py, pz, E, weight}.

total_number_mCP_include_shower.nb includes the total number of mCP and anti-mCP for production.
